How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I could compare the codes and figure out what the typo was.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I could search for the negative and positive sign, and then find the bug and fix it.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro is that you know what you are downloading and you make sure it is getting downloaded. A con is you can forget and loose everything.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because you can save more files this way and have more storage.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    You can put it in the terminal and plug in the commands.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I assume it won't break and is more reliable than other coding/downloadable sites

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

 Coding a game and website and gain a greater understanding.
