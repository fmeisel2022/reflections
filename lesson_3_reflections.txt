Lesson 3

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

1. If we are working from multiple computers.
2. If multiple people are working on the same repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There may be conflicts between the current work I'm doing and the
    remote repository. There may be changes to the same part of the code.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Branch: Created on a single repository.
Clone: Copy an entire repository from a local/remote location.
Fork: Clone a repository in GitHub itself.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

Offline access to previous commit history.
We can merge this remote state with our local state and then push the
updated state on GitHub.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    It would be easier to communicate on piazza and harder on atom.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    You could want to make changes that only effect one copy of the repository.
